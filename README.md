# ShortedPathOnGraph 


This project have a classes that simulating a unidirectional weighted graph with algorithms that manipulating it.
the graph is calculated to perform in the best way as possible and for doing that it is used with BFS Dijkstra algorithms.
the project also have a test files for every class.

### Nedded for installing
* **[JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)**
* **[intllij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)** or some other **IDE**

## Culculate the shortest path with Dijktra's algorithm
**see [Dijkstra's algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) for more info.**

### For installing the project 
Get this [Shorted Path project](https://github.com/Idanturjeman/ShortedPathOnGraph) to your own computer with your workspace directory.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Idanturjeman/ShortedPathOnGraph.git

```
