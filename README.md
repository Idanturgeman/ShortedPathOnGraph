# ShortedPathOnGraph 


This project have a classes that simulating a unidirectional weighted graph with algorithms that manipulating it.
the graph is calculated to perform in the best way as possible and for doing that it is used with BFS Dijkstra algorithms.
the project also have a test files for every class.

## calculate the shorted path with dijktra's algorithm

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Idanturjeman/ShortedPathOnGraph.git

```
